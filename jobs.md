We are currently looking for a Registry Engineer and a Support Tech, as well as an intern (for summer 2015). Even if none of those is what you're interested in, if you would like to work with us and have skills you think would be helpful, please send an email with evidence of your experience (like your resume, or links to LinkedIn/GitHub/wherever) to [jobs@npmjs.com](mailto:jobs@npmjs.com).

We’d like to hear from you.

## Registry Engineer

The npm registry is on track to serve more than a billion package downloads a month, with peak traffic over 3200 requests per second. The registry is now robust and performant, and we have a new website and a faster, more reliable command-line client. This means we've been able to expand what we do, with the release of npm Enterprise last year and the upcoming release of private module support.

As part of the Registry team, you'll be working on a service used by millions of developers, and contributing to many of our open-source projects to do it. In 2015 that's going to include private modules, support for teams and organizations, and improvements to npm Enterprise.

We're looking for an experienced engineer who understands the importance of maintainable code and comprehensive tests, who values simple, composable services. We expect you to understand modern source control, and be a fan of deployment automation. We have a pragmatic approach to architectural and technology choices, and hope you will too.

Like all npm engineers, you'll be expected to handle operational tasks. We expect this role to be about 80% development, 20% operations, so you need to be actively interested in getting operational stuff right, because we take our uptime very seriously.

The majority of your output will be open source code and we actively encourage you to develop and release open-source tooling that helps the broader node.js community; anything that helps node users helps us.

We are accepting remote candidates for this role but will give precedence to candidates who are local to our offices in Oakland, California, or at least in a nearby time zone.


## Support Tech

npm has more than 3 million users worldwide and that number is growing fast. Their use-cases are incredibly diverse: from systems administrators writing automation tools, to hobbyists building robots, to back-end engineers building mobile app APIs, to millions of front-end developers.

And every day, tens of thousands of brand new users show up.

Our mission at npm is to reduce developer friction. We do it by building tools that make JavaScript developers' lives easier, by maintaining a registry with better than 99.999% uptime, and by answering each of the tweets, emails, and GitHub issues that our users send us every day.

npm has been successful because we care about our users.  "npm loves you" is not just marketing; it's a core company value.

To that end, we're building out a dedicated support team.  The right person for this job combines empathy and communication skills with a passion for solving technical problems.  Experience with Open Source and customer service are beneficial, but not required.

Your job will be to serve as the first line of support, fielding common questions, building up FAQs, and solving the unusual or complicated cases yourself, with the help of every member of the engineering team (who are the ones currently doing all these things).

By directly helping our users and customers, and interacting with every member of the team, you'll gain the kind of cross-company insight that is so valuable to a career in technology.  You'll be the first full-time member of this team, but not the last.

You'll report directly to Isaac, CEO and inventor of npm, and a former front-line support tech himself.  You'll be a full employee with all benefits, including competitive salary and stock options.  We are not accepting remote candidates for this role.


## About npm, Inc.

npm is the package manager for JavaScript. The team is small, and growing quickly. If you join us, you will see the company grow through numerous changes, and take a bunch of different roles.

npm’s mission is to take Open Source development to entirely new places. When everyone else is adding force, we work to reduce friction.

npm is not a typical product, and we are not a typical early-stage “work hard/play hard” startup. We are responsible adults with diverse backgrounds and interests, who take our careers and our lives seriously. We believe that the best way to iterate towards success is by taking care of ourselves, our families, our users, and one another. We aim for a sustainable approach to work and life, because that is the best way to maximize long-term speed, while retaining clarity of vision. Compassion is our strategy.

We offer very competitive salaries, meaningful equity, and generous health, dental and vision benefits. We love it when you represent us at conferences.
