# Nice People Matter: npm is hiring

We are actively hiring for a [Client Executive](/client-executive) role.

We’d like to hear from you.

## SALES ENGINEER

[npm Enterprise](https://www.npmjs.org/enterprise) is the software that powers the public npm registry, condensed into an easy-to-maintain appliance that runs inside your network. Our customers use it to decrease latency, satisfy stringent legal or security requirements, and to build fully-internal deployment automation.

Interest in npm Enterprise has been enormous and has outstripped our bandwidth to talk to new customers and get them started with the software. We're looking for somebody with a technical background who has moved into a sales role and enjoys being there. Your compensation will include commissions.

You'll be reaching out to new customers, walking them through installations via email, phone, video chats and in-person demos. You'll be helping them debug hitches in their integrations and, when appropriate, turning their problems and requirements into bug reports or feature requests.

In addition to helping our enterprise customers directly, npm Enterprise shares many components with the npm public registry, so your work on those pieces will be open-source and used by millions of people every day.

We are accepting remote candidates for this role, but most of our customers are in the US, so you will have to be comfortable working during US business hours, and precedence will be given to candidates local to our offices in Oakland, California.

### About npm, Inc.

npm is the package manager for JavaScript. The team is small, and growing quickly. If you join us, you will see the company grow through numerous changes, and take a bunch of different roles.

npm’s mission is to take Open Source development to entirely new places. When everyone else is adding force, we work to reduce friction.

npm is not a typical product, and we are not a typical early-stage “work hard/play hard” startup. We are responsible adults with diverse backgrounds and interests, who take our careers and our lives seriously. We believe that the best way to iterate towards success is by taking care of ourselves, our families, our users, and one another. We aim for a sustainable approach to work and life, because that is the best way to maximize long-term speed, while retaining clarity of vision. Compassion is our strategy.

We offer very competitive salaries, meaningful equity, and generous health, dental and vision benefits. We love it when you represent us at conferences.
