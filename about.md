# About npm

npm is lots of things.

npm is the official package manager for [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/).

npm is a community of developers who share and use JavaScript packages in Node.js and other places people use JavaScript, like [front-end web apps](http://www.ember-cli.com/) and [mobile apps](http://cordova.apache.org/) and [robots](https://tessel.io/) and [routers](https://linerate.f5.com/).

The npm Registry is the public collection of packages of open-source JavaScript code built by that community.

npm is the command line client that allows developers to install and publish those JavaScript packages.

npm, Inc. is a company that hosts and maintains all of the above.

# About npm, Inc.

npmâ€™s mission is to take Open Source development to entirely new places. When everyone else is adding force, we work to reduce friction.

npm is not a typical product, and we are not a typical "work hard/play hard" startup. We are responsible adults with diverse backgrounds and interests, who take our careers and our lives seriously. We believe that the best way to iterate towards success is by taking care of ourselves, our families, our users, and one another. We aim for a sustainable approach to work and life, because that is the best way to maximize long-term speed, while retaining clarity of vision. Compassion is our strategy.

Our offices are in downtown Oakland, California.
